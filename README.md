# 3D Printed Full-Size Polyphonic Organ Keyboard

## Features
  * Full-size keyboard
  * 8-way polyphony
  * 9 drawbars to adjust harmonics
  * Range C0 through B7 (96 notes)

## Directories
  * src - Source code for the microcontroller (an AVR ATtiny861A)
  * pcb/sensor - PCB for the sensor board
  * pcb/controller PCB for the controller board
  * scad - OpenSCAD design

## Function Keys

Holding the "function" key on the controller PCB causes switches
to function mode:

  * Tuning (saved in EEPROM)
    * F#0 - Flatten
    * G#0 - Reset
    * A#0 - Sharpen

## 3D Printed Parts

  * Keybed
  * White keys (7)
  * Black keys (5)
  * Assembly tool (to help attach the rubber bands)
  * Control board

## Keys

Each note is controlled by a limit switch. The output of the limit
switches are latched and then processed serially using two
74HC165s per octave (since there are only 12 notes in an octave,
that 4 bits are wasted for simplicity).

In software, the state of each key is recorded in a bitmap.

## Waves

Waveforms are generated by sampling a 256 point sine wave.
The base waveform is at half the fundamental frequency (16')
allowing us to generate the necessary harmonics:

  * 16'     - Sub-Octave (1x)
  * 5 1/3'  - Quint (3x)
  * 8'      - Principal (2x)
  * 4'      - Octave (4x)
  * 2 2/3'  - Nazard (6x)
  * 2'      - Super Octave (8x)
  * 1 3/5'  - Tierce (10x)
  * 1 1/3'  - Larigot (12x)
  * 1'      - Super-Super Octave (16x)

When a drawbar is changed, the waveform is recomputed by adding
together the contributions from each drawbar. The final value is
scaled down by the total contribution.
